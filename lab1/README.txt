Section 01I

Think about how you would make the digit display if you didnâ€™t have one. Write out how you would approach doing so.

I would represent the desired number based on binary using LEDS lined up in a row. Let 0 = light off , 1 = light on.

Make some sort of guess on how that random number generator works? How can things be really random in a computer with logic gates being so, well, logical?

Based on the lab results, I would guess that random number generators have nested loops of numbers generated by two distinct algorithms. The nested loops
run, and when the numbers match up, that number is the number selected to be the "random" number.
